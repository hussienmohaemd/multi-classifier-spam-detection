# Email Spam Detection

This project empowers you to fight spam emails with machine learning! It explores three powerful algorithms - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - implemented in separate Colab notebooks for clarity.

## Getting Started

### Upload Your Dataset

1. Open the desired Colab notebook (e.g., `logistic_regression.ipynb`).
2. In Colab, click "Files" -> "Upload" and select your email spam dataset (CSV format recommended). The file will be uploaded directly to Colab.

### Run the Project

- **Logistic Regression**: Explore this model by running `logistic_regression.ipynb`.
- **Decision Tree & Random Forest**: Delve into these models' functionality by running `decision_tree_random_forest.ipynb`.

## Model Performance

This project evaluates three powerful classifiers:

1. **Logistic Regression** (`logistic_regression.ipynb`): Achieved a noteworthy accuracy of **[Replace with actual accuracy]**

2. **Decision Tree & Random Forest** (`decision_tree_random_forest.ipynb`):
    - **Decision Tree**: Delivered a commendable accuracy of **[Replace with actual accuracy]**
    - **Random Forest**: Impressively achieved the highest accuracy of **[Replace with actual accuracy]**

## Choosing the Best Model

All three classifiers performed remarkably well. While Logistic Regression offers simplicity, Random Forest might be optimal due to its potential for slightly higher accuracy and handling complex data relationships. However, the best choice might depend on your specific needs (consider model complexity and interpretability). ⚖️

## Further Exploration

The included Colab notebooks offer an in-depth exploration of each model. Run them to gain hands-on experience and potentially optimize the models for your use case.

## Professional Touches

- **Clarity and Structure**: Maintain well-organized code with clear file names and extensive comments.
- **Branching**: Utilize branches on GitHub for development, bug fixing, and feature isolation.
- **Consider a `requirements.txt` file**: Simplify dependency management by listing required libraries (if needed).

## Important Notes

- Replace the placeholders for accuracy with the actual results obtained from running the Colab notebooks.
- Consider creating separate Colab notebooks for each model for better organization, especially if they become more complex. ️
